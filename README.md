See the "bridge" directory for code to use this board as an opto-isolated
USB serial bridge.

See the "analysis" directory for code used to analyze the resulting logs.

You can [buy the PCB directly from
OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/APZSUiwL) if you'd like to use it.

If you use the board, it would be super cool of you to give us credit.

The BOM is in BOM.csv
